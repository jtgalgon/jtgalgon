# Hello I'm Josh Galgon
I am currently studying computer science at UW Madison. I mainly code in Java. I love the idea of games, and often goof around with C# in Unity. I am familiar with other languages such 
as Python and Assembly, and I look forward to learning and mastering more over this summer. My main goal for June-August 2021 is feel much more confident with my coding abilities and 
Github usage for the following semesters. I look forward to learning everyday!
